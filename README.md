I am Roshan Suvarna a student of analytical studies and a SAP Consultant by profession is here to write a blog on Certification on Data science and Big data.There are lots of  Degree,Diplomas and certification for Big data and Data science around the globe.But first i will talk about the Certification which i did and i will tell you my experience with the training and the certification  exams.




I am talking about two Data Science certification which is provided Dell EMC,we all know about this american giant company.Well those of you who don't know about this company Dell EMC major business is to sell data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other products and services that enable businesses to store, manage, protect, and analyze data.

Now lets come talk about the certifications:

Pass the following Associate level exam:

This certification will qualify towards the Specialist level certification in the EMC Proven Professional Data Scientist (EMCDS) track including the following: EMC Data Scientist, Advanced Analytics Specialist.

My Take on Data Science Associate (EMCDSA) :

I attended the Video ILT - stream course which you can say a self pace course.This is a recorded video of a actual classroom session which took place in EMC classroom(not sure about classroom though :P).This course is divided in modules so this helps us to keep track which module we completed.The best part i liked in this video is it is a actual Class room session so we can see and hear the interaction between faculty and students which allow us to explore more about the topics.

Now the main concern is i am  paying money for Video ILT then how will i practice???
Don't worry guys Dell EMC providing you with Lab access and infact module also contains Lab practises so that you can get your hand dirty.
Remember nobody will baby feed you so you need to practise :)

There are also Instructor led classroom session.You can approach Dell EMC via there website:"https://education.emc.com".

Lets talk about exams in PDF link below it is mentioned that from which topic how many percentage of questions will come.There also practise test which is made available to student so that he or she can evaluate themselves before the certification exams.And as per my experience exam was a bit competitive.

I will not talk about cost of  the certification because it vary country to country and also not about its market value because still i am a student and i need to evaluate this certification worth during my interviews :)
